    @brief Basic application that presents the lwIP usage with S32R418AA RTD

    ## Application description ##
    _____
    The purpose of this demo is to provide the user with an out-of-the box
    example application for S32R418AA platform, using S32 RTD.
    The demo uses lwIP stack and supports more scenarios, which can be enabled
    or disabled on <b>Applications</b>, by modifying the \b lwipcfg.h file located in \b generate\include\.

    Basic functionality can be checked by pinging the board from the host PC:
        ping 192.168.0.200

    Please note that a prior setting of the IP on your PC might be needed. On Windows, this can be done from:

    <b>Control Panel</b> > <b>Network and Internet</b> > <b>Network and Sharing Center</b> > <b>Change adapter settings</b> > <b>Network adapter that connects to the board</b>

    Select <b>Internet Protocol Version 4</b> and click <b>Properties</b>; select <b>Use the following IP address</b> and configure the IP address and subnet mask.
    Configuration example: IP - 192.168.0.10, subnet mask - 255.255.255.0.

    For more information about supported application, you can see the "TCPIP_USER_MANUAL.pdf" that is contained by this package, located on "S32DS/software/{RTD_PACKAGE}/stacks/tcpip/doc".
    
    ## Prerequisites ##
    _____
    To run the example you will need to have the following items:
    - 1 S32R418AA Board
    - 1 Power Adapter 12V
    - 1 Personal Computer
    - 1 S32 Debug Probe

    ## Hardware supported ##
    _____
    The following hardware is supported by this application:
		- Board: X-S32R41-EVB PCB 48194 RevD SCH RevD
		- Silicon: S32R418AAMUF 0P99C SBAA2239B (P/S32R418AAU(K1) MUFT (Rev 1.1))
    ## How to run ##
    ______
    #### 1. Importing the project into the workspace ####
    After opening S32 Design Studio, go to \b File -> \b New -> \b S32DS \b Project \b From \bExample and select \b lwip_S32R418AA_baremetal_M7_0. Then click on \b Finish. \n
    The project should now be copied into you current workspace.
    Wait for the S32 Configuration was initialized and ready.

    #### 2. Generating the S32 configuration ####
    The example will run without an active configuration, however if any changes are required, a configuration needs to be generated.
    The initial configuration will have the same settings as the default example settings.
    First go to \b Project \b Explorer View in S32 DS and select the current project(\b lwip_S32R418AA_baremetal_M7_0).
    Select the "S32 Configuration Tool" menu then click on the desired configuration (Pins, Cocks, Peripherals etc...). Clicking on any one of those will generate all the components.
    Make the desired changes(if any) then click on the "S32 Configuration Tool->Update Code" button.
    #### 3. Building the project ####
    Select the configuration to be built \b RAM (Debug_RAM) by left clicking on the downward arrow corresponding to the \b build button(@image hammer.png).
    Wait for the build action to be completed before continuing to the next step.
    #### 4. Running the project ####
    Go to \b Run and select \b Debug \b Configurations. There will be a debug configuration for this project:
     Configuration Name                        | Description
     ------------------------------------------|------------
     \b lwip_S32R418AA_baremetal_M7_0_Debug_RAM_S32Debug    | Debug the RAM configuration using S32 Debug Probe debuggers

    \n Select the desired debug configuration and click on \b Launch. Now the perspective will change to the \b Debug \b Perspective. \n
    Use the controls to control the program flow.

    #### 5. Expected results ####

    After executing "ping 192.168.0.200" cmd, command windows will display :
        Pinging 192.168.0.200 with 32 bytes of data:
        Reply from 192.168.0.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
        Reply from 192.168.0.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
        Reply from 192.168.0.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
        Reply from 192.168.0.200: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=255
        Ping statistics for 192.168.0.200:
        Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
        Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
        Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms
